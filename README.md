Tic-Tac-Toe but online! And with an open source simple Node.js server! (from which comes the name by the way)

Features include:
- Win/Lose detection
- Draw detection
- Online pairing
- And most importantly, an integrated chat to speak with your opponents!

I may or may not add changes to this project, but i think it is complete.
