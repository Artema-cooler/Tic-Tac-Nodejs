Tic-Tac-Toe but online! And with an open source simple Node.js server! (from which comes the name by the way)

Features include:
- Win/Lose detection
- Draw detection
- Pairing online players together and randomly deciding their symbols
- And most importantly, an integrated chat to speak with your opponents!

I may or may not add changes to this project, but i think it is complete.


Big thank you for Sasha and Oleg, they are my classmates and they helped very much with playtesting! (They don't have their GitHub accounts yet but i'll name them here)
